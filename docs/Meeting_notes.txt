1. create power point presentations for two projects:
   - project statemenet
   - flow chart
   - input data  what it is and where it came from 
   - output data
2. Fix the four doucments 
What am I trying to do?

I am trying to accomplish two tasks in the next two weeks:
  First task: use alglib api to compute fft of a time domain vector
  - Looking at alglib api i have found the fft function whose signature is void fftc1d(complex_1d_array &a)
  - fftc1d takes a char array of time domain data and computes fft in place of the input time domain vector
  - For the input of the fftc1d function, read a text file (*csv) containing time domain data and input it in the fftc1d function
     - There are two ways to generate data: 
	1. Manual entry of data
	2. Testable data such as a sine wave at a specific frequency  
	   - From the internet get a sine sample data
           - Find a function that generates a sine wave data
  - Write the output of the fftc1d function (frequency domain data) in a text file (*csv)

 Second Task: Create a CPP .dll and expose its API to Java
 - I begin by creating a DLL file and then make a .cpp file that has the code to be exposed to Java
 - Then I create a header file that holds the JNI implementation  
 - Through .dll properties from VC++ Directories I added Java directories by giving the path in Include directories
 - I created a java project file and added my JNI code.
 - In the last step I include the path of the native library (which is the DLL file) location through the Java build path

	 - Rename files with _ instead of spaces in the name  
 - Redo presentation with different approaches
 - Redo meeting file text for project 2
	- Identify what you know and what you dont know (using understand and don't understand)
	- Save images with naming such as kalb_cppcon_inheritance
 	- Ensure everything is aligned and proof read
 	- Put all the notes together under one file notes.txt, 
 	- ensure the notes are all organized
 	- Remove three files: Object orientented programming, functional templates and exceptions
	- Proof read the journal and if needed organize it better
 	- Install TortoiseGit 
 - Find out how to retrieve previous todo list from git, copy the content into meeting notes and then delete the to-do list.
