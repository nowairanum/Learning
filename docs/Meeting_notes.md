 - How to create Submodules in Git?
 - Understand Mathematical Calculation of fourier signal and solve a question
 - Reuse implementation and test from cpp to java and python 
 - Understand and be ready to teach the following topics: 
	 i. Smart C++ pointers and Raw C pointers, What are pros/cons for each? What are use cases for each?
	 ii. Sorting, 4 different methods, what's the time complexity and space complexity for each of them
	 iii. Implement a Linkedlist, along with basic functions, also implement a basic sorting algorithm (maybe bubble sort, easy) for it. 
	 iv. Searching, 4 different methods, what's the time complexity and space complexity for each of them
	 v. Implement a Tree, along with basic functions, also implement a basic searching algorthim (maybe dfs/bfs) for it.

1. create PowerPoint presentations for two projects:
   - project statement
   - flow chart
   - input data  what it is and where it came from 
   - output data
2. Fix the four documents 
What am I trying to do?

I am trying to accomplish two tasks in the next two weeks:
  First task: use alglib API to compute FFT of a time-domain vector
  - Looking at alglib API I have found the FFT function whose signature is void fftc1d(complex_1d_array &a)
  - fftc1d takes a char array of time-domain data and computes FFT in place of the input time-domain vector
  - For the input of the fftc1d function, read a text file (*CSV) containing time-domain data and input it in the fftc1d function
     - There are two ways to generate data: 
	1. Manual entry of data
	2. Testable data such as a sine wave at a specific frequency  
	   - From the internet get a sine sample data
           - Find a function that generates a sine wave data
  - Write the output of the fftc1d function (frequency domain data) in a text file (*CSV)

 Second Task: Create a CPP .dll and expose its API to Java
 Approach 1: 
  - I begin by creating a DLL file and then implement my program code in the .cpp file which has to be exposed to Java
  - Then I create a header file that holds the JNI implementation which I manually enter
  - Through .dll properties from VC++ Directories I added Java directories by giving the path in include directories
  - I created a java project file and added my JNI code.
  - In the last step I include the path of the native library (which is the DLL file) location through the Java build path
 Approach 2:
  - I begin by creating a DLL file and then make a .cpp file that has the code to be exposed to Java
  - Then I create a Swig wrapper file using CMD which is added to the project files
  - Once I run the program the Java code is automatically generated by Java

	- Rename files with _ instead of spaces in the name  
	- Redo meeting file text for project 2
	- Identify what you know and what you don't know (using understand and don't understand)
	- Save images with naming such as kalb_cppcon_inheritance
 	- Ensure everything is aligned and proofread
 	- Put all the notes together under one file notes.txt, 
 	- ensure the notes are all organized
 	- Remove three files: Object orientated programming, functional templates, and exceptions
	- Proofread the journal and if needed organize it better
 	- Install TortoiseGit 
 - Find out how to retrieve the previous to-do list from git, copy the content into meeting notes and then delete the to-do list.
 - Redo presentation with different approaches
