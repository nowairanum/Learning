What am I trying to do?

I am trying to accomplish two tasks in the next two weeks:
  First task: use alglib api to compute fft of a time domain vector
  - Looking at alglib api i have found the fft function whose signature is void fftc1d(complex_1d_array &a)
  - fftc1d takes a char array of time domain data and computes fft in place of the input time domain vector
  - For the input of the fftc1d function, read a text file (*csv) containing time domain data and input it in the fftc1d function
     - There are two ways to generate data: 
	1. Manual entry of data
	2. Testable data such as a sine wave at a specific frequency  
	   - From the internet get a sine sample data
           - Find a function that generates a sine wave data
  - Write the output of the fftc1d function (frequency domain data) in a text file (*csv)

 Second task: create a CPP .dll and expose its API to java
 - I begin by creating a DLL file and then make a .cpp file that has the code to be exposed to Jave
 - Then I create a header file that holds the JNI implementation  
 - Through .dll properties from VC++ Directories I added Java directories by giving the path in Include directories
 - I created a java project file and added my JNI code.
 - In the last step I include the path of the native library (which is the DLL file) location through the Java build path
